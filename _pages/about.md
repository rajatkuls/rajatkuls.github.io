I am an Applied Scientist on the AGI Foundations team at Amazon, where I work on multimodal LLMs used across real-time Amazon experiences. My work focuses on post-training, data, and inference efficiency, with an emphasis on making speech-language models fast, reliable, and practical to deploy in production.

I have led and contributed to speculative decoding, end-to-end latency and throughput optimizations, and designed evaluation and release pipelines for large and on-device models. Across projects, my goal is to bridge modeling and systems to translate research ideas into measurable improvements in real-world responsiveness and usability.

Previously, I was a founding engineer at Telling.ai, where I built speech-first AI systems for longitudinal respiratory health monitoring and helped take research prototypes into clinical-grade production systems.

I have over 8 years of experience in AI research and engineering. I hold a research master’s degree in Language Technologies from Carnegie Mellon University and a bachelor’s degree in Electronics & Electrical Engineering (with a minor in Computer Science) from IIT Guwahati.

Outside of work, I enjoy obsessively optimizing my coffee—and then applying the same mindset to rapidly prototyping ideas. A recent project, [LLM Powered After Visit Summary](https://eyekapoor.com), was selected for a panel discussion at the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

I’m best reached at rk.kuls [at] gmail.com. More details are in my [CV](/files/cv.pdf). A full list of my publications can be found [here]({{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}) and on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WM92KKkAAAAJ).
