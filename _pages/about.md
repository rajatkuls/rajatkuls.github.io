I am an Applied Scientist in the AGI Foundations team at Amazon building multimodal, real-time foundation models used across Amazon experiences. My team leads efforts in multimodal speech–language capabilities, specifically in post-training, data, and inference efficiency workstreams. I have also built and maintained on-device evaluation and release pipelines, with a focus on making large models responsive, reliable, and practical in production. Previously, I was a founding engineer at Telling.ai, where I built speech-first AI systems for respiratory health monitoring.

I have 7+ years of AI research and engineering experience. I hold a research master’s degree in Language Technologies from Carnegie Mellon University and a bachelor’s degree in Electronics & Electrical Engineering (with a CS minor) from IIT Guwahati.

In my free time, I enjoy optimizing my coffee and subsequently rapidly prototyping ideas and recipes. Check out my recent project [LLM Powered After Visit Summary](https://eyekapoor.com) that was selected for a panel discussion at the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

I’m best reached at rk.kuls [at] gmail.com. More details are in my [CV](/files/cv.pdf). A full list of my publications can be found [here]({{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}) and on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WM92KKkAAAAJ).
